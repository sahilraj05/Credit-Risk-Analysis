## Credit-Risk-Analysis
# 1.	About the data:<br>
The German Credit data set is a publically available data set downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The data contains data on 20 variables and the classification whether an applicant is considered a Good or a Bad credit risk for 1000 loan applicants.
# 2.	Goal:<br>
•   	Handle missing values<br>
•   	Analyze different distributions and relationships<br>
•   	Do feature engineering on the dataset<br>
•   	Determine the classifiers we are going to use<br>
•     Determine the classifiers we are going to use<br>
•   	Determine the evaluation metric to select the best model<br>
•   	Model the data and determine the best model based on the evaluation metric to correctly predict the category( good risk or bad risk) for individual cases
# 3.  Outline:<br>
•     Info of the data<br>
•   	Handling missing values<br>
•   	Exploring some variables:<br>
&emsp;◦	Distribution of target variable across different independent variables<br>
&emsp;◦	Relationship between different independent variables<br>
•     Feature Engineering<br>
•     Log transformation of numerical variable<br>
•     Model Data:<br>
&emsp;◦  Logistic Regression<br>
&emsp;◦  K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN)<br>
&emsp;◦  Random Forest Classifier<br>
&emsp;◦  Support Vector Classifier(SVC)<br>

&emsp;*Note: Hyperparameter tuning wherever applicable<br>*
•     Evaluating the model<br>
•     Plotting ROC Curve<br>
•     Choosing the best model
