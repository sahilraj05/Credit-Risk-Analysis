## Credit-Risk-Analysis
# 1.	About the data:<br>
The German Credit data set is a publically available data set downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The data contains data on 20 variables and the classification whether an applicant is considered a Good or a Bad credit risk for 1000 loan applicants.
# 2.	Goal:<br>
2.1.	Handle missing values<br>
2.2.	Analyze different distributions and relationships<br>
2.3.	Do feature engineering on the dataset<br>
2.4.	Determine the classifiers we are going to use<br>
2.5.	Determine the evaluation metric to select the best model<br>
2.6.	Model the data and determine the best model based on the evaluation metric to correctly predict the category( good risk or bad risk) for individual cases
